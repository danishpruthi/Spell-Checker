Near Habour Bay and BCS Mall. Strong Wifi n g8 Security.But the breakfast is not 4* Hotel, tasteless food.The flora spa is very disappointing......the room is not cleaned and smell of cigarete.There is no sop for shower aft milk bath.Drinks were not given after the spa and massage. Wen requested for extra towel n pillow....... we did not recv'd till we checked out. The railings at balcony is dusty. u shd be vry careful with ur little ones.Dis is really scary for ppl with younng children.In the toilet,theres no holder to place body foam and shampoo. The tv signal is alwayz lost.

It was pleasant stay.However, on  first breakfast we had, it's disappointing.Too overcrowded & the breakfast buffet was not even many dur to the crowd...........Everyone is like fighting food food.No system in controlling the food for refilling on the buffet table. I went breakfast at 830am(wib) but the spread left is only like 20%.Utterly disappointed...... I don like this place becoz I m utterly disappointed......wil not recomend......Should not be graded as 4*. Even the lift that is operational.We have to wait about 5-6 mins to go down frm our level 12.........Paid for a premium suite but its not wat we saw as depicted in the galery of photoz in the website.eg, the jacuzzi in suite is not even working & on top of that, its smaller den a normal bath tub. Utterly disappointed :(

grt thing about BCC which no other hotel can beat is its huge rooms :) I booked Premier............ which was 62sq feet n comes with a dining room n bedroom. Being alone, it was a bit of an overkill. But on  low side, the carpets are old, hair dryer nt working and many things are getting worn out so those wanting to book a huge room with very good wifi (full bar as each room has a repeater) can get it before it gets rundown. However, beware of the counter staffs asking you for upgrades, its a sham! I upgraded to a 110$ room first time round and found out it was a normal deluxe rm,worse with sanitary pipe above (stink like high heaven) and bad cleanliness........very dirty room.So choose well ;)

"Stayed with sister-in-law and family with kids from 2-8yo in a 2-bedroom apt....... Kids had lots of fun with the spacious hall to run around. Adults had a good time bonding around the kitchenette. Room was spacious and clean. Beds was comfortable. Toilets was clean. Didn't get a chance to go to the pool or order Room service. But breakfast was ok. Delicious with variety. 

However, housekeeping tuk a long time to deliver the iron/iron board........ kept calling 3-4 times and only got it sent nearing bedtime....... Sent toilet paper instead of the iron at first. Had a little mishap with the bidet and the maintenance took a while to come and fix it. only 1 card key to tap for the lift and the Room. Not so great Cuz We had to keep going to the lobby to get a bell boy to give us access to our level everytime. "
